# Bundle Animation Types — Complete Map

Date: 2026-03-20
Status: research
Purpose: Map all player/NPC animation types for future bundle template expansion

## AHSW Equipment State Encoding

Every character sprite uses the naming convention `{family}-{AHSW}.xp` where the
4-digit suffix encodes equipment state:

| Digit | Meaning | Values |
|-------|---------|--------|
| A | Armor   | 0 = none, 1 = wearing |
| H | Helmet  | 0 = none, 1 = wearing |
| S | Shield  | 0 = none, 1 = holding |
| W | Weapon  | 0 = none, 1 = melee, 2 = ranged/heavy |

W is ternary (0/1/2). A, H, S are binary (0/1).
Max combinations per family: 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 24 variants.

## Sprite Families

### Player Families (overrideable for custom skins)

| Family | Animation | Variants in repo | Dims (chars) | Angles | Frames | Layers | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `player-nude` | Idle/walk (undressed) | 1 | 126x72 | 8 | [1,8] | 3 | Special: no AHSW suffix |
| `player` | Idle/walk | 24 (W=0,1,2) | 126x80 | 8 | [1,8] | 4 | All equipment combos |
| `attack` | Attack swing | 8 (W=1 only) | 144x80 | 8 | [8] | 4 | Only exists when W>=1 (need weapon to attack) |
| `plydie` | Death | 24 (W=0,1,2) | 110x88 | 8 | [5] | 3 | All equipment combos |
| `wolfie` | Mount idle/walk | 24 (W=0,1,2) | 180x96-104 | 8 | varies | 4 | Mounted player on wolf |
| `wolack` | Mount attack | 8 (W=1 only) | 160x104 | 8 | varies | 5-6 | Mounted attack (need weapon) |

### NPC Families (also in sprites/)

| Family | Animation | Variants in repo | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| `bigbee` | NPC enemy | 24 (W=0,1,2) | 66x104 chars, 4-5 layers |

### Non-AHSW Sprites (items, UI, etc.)

| Pattern | Count | Examples |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `grid-*.xp` | 30 | Inventory grid icons (sword, apple, armor...) |
| `item-*.xp` | 27 | World-dropped item sprites |
| `keyb-*.xp` | 5 | Keyboard layout sprites |
| `font-1.xp` | 1 | Font atlas |
| Other | ~5 | `asciicker.xp`, `character.xp`, `fire.xp`, etc. |

## Current Bundle Template Coverage

### `player_native_full` (current)

The only bundle template currently used for acceptance testing:

| Action | Family | Reference XP | AHSW range label | Current server-side override names | Status |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------------|------------------------------------|--------|
| idle | `player` | `player-0100.xp` | `all_16` | `player-nude.xp` + `player-{AHSW}.xp` for A,H,S in `{0,1}` and W in `{0,1,2}` | Tested |
| attack | `attack` | `attack-0001.xp` | `weapon_gte_1` | `attack-{AHSW}.xp` for A,H,S in `{0,1}` and W in `{1,2}` | Tested |
| death | `plydie` | `plydie-0000.xp` | `all_16` | `plydie-{AHSW}.xp` for A,H,S in `{0,1}` and W in `{0,1,2}` | Tested |

**Important naming caveat:** `all_16` is now a legacy template label, not a literal count.
Current server-side bundle payload generation emits ternary weapon variants (`W=0/1/2`)
for enabled families via `_action_override_names()` in `src/pipeline_v2/service.py`.

**What "weapon_gte_1" means today:** Only AHSW combos where W >= 1 are generated. Current
server-side behavior emits both W=1 and W=2 names. Attack animations only exist with a
weapon equipped.

### What's missing from the bundle

| Family | Gap | Impact |
|--------|-----|--------|
| `player-nude` | Not in any bundle template | Undressed player (before equipping anything) not customizable |
| `wolfie` | Not in bundle | Mounted idle — player rides wolf with default skin when mounted |
| `wolack` | Not in bundle | Mounted attack — same as above |
| Browser debug override parity | `?overridemode=` lists are still binary `0000..1111` | Debug-only override paths still miss ternary W=2 coverage |
| `bigbee` | Not in bundle | NPC enemy — would need a separate NPC skin system |

## Override Modes in Code

There are now two distinct override-generation paths, and they do not match:

### 1. Browser debug override modes in `web/workbench.js`

These are query-param driven debug lists for the webbuild iframe (`?overridemode=`). They
are still legacy binary loops.

### Default "mounted" mode (49 names)
```
player-nude.xp
player-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
wolfie-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
wolack-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
```
Excludes attack/plydie to avoid destabilizing NPCs that share those filenames.

### `full_parity` mode (81 names)
```
player-nude.xp
player-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
attack-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
plydie-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
wolfie-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
wolack-{0000..1111}.xp   (16)
```
WARNING: FS-global — NPCs sharing attack/plydie filenames inherit the custom skin.

### These browser debug modes still do NOT cover W=2 variants
Both loops use binary encoding (i=0..15 → `0000..1111`), so they still miss the 8 W=2
variants per family.

### 2. Server-side bundle payload override names in `service.py`

This is the path used by the current bundle-native workbench acceptance flow:

- `all_16` emits ternary W values (`0/1/2`) for enabled families
- `weapon_gte_1` emits W values `1` and `2`
- this is the current product-truth path for bundle payload injection

So the W=2 gap now applies to the browser debug override lists, not the server-side bundle
payload path.

## Gameplay Trigger Map

| State | Sprite loaded | Triggered by |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Nude/spawn | `player-nude.xp` | Initial spawn before any equipment |
| Idle/walk | `player-{AHSW}.xp` | Standing, walking (equipment-dependent) |
| Attack | `attack-{AHS1}.xp` or `attack-{AHS2}.xp` | Attacking with weapon equipped |
| Death | `plydie-{AHSW}.xp` | Player dies |
| Mounted idle | `wolfie-{AHSW}.xp` | Riding mount, idle/walking |
| Mounted attack | `wolack-{AHS1}.xp` | Riding mount, attacking |
| Item pickup | Changes AHSW state | Equipping armor/helmet/shield/weapon |

When the player picks up a sword: the game switches from `player-0000.xp` to
`player-0001.xp` (W=0→1). If `player-0001.xp` wasn't overridden by the bundle,
it falls back to the built-in WASM data package version.

## Recommended Future Bundle Expansions

### Priority 1: Mount support (wolfie + wolack)
- Already in the default override set
- Gives full coverage for mounted gameplay
- 32 additional XP files (16 wolfie + 16 wolack)
- Different dimensions from player (180x96-104 and 160x104)
- Would need new template entries in `config/template_registry.json`

### Priority 2: Browser debug override parity
- Extend `web/workbench.js` debug override loops to ternary W coverage
- Align browser debug override names with current server-side bundle payload behavior
- Removes the remaining W=2 mismatch between debug injection and bundle payload injection

### Priority 3: player-nude
- Single file, simple addition
- Covers the naked spawn state
- Different dimensions (126x72 vs 126x80) — may need template adjustment

### Priority 4: NPC skins (bigbee etc.)
- Would need a separate template family and NPC-aware override system
- Risk: FS-global overrides affect all entities sharing a filename
- Lower priority — player skin is the core use case
